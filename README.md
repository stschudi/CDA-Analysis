# CDA-Analysis
Analyzes past Connecticut Debate Association data.

This project takes the data from the CDA debate result sheets (http://ctdebate.org/) and parses through to create a graph of debaters and judges.

It then analyzes the data to compute statistics about each debater, judge, school, etc. Statistics include: win rate, total rounds, average score, aff vs neg win rate, elo score, glicko score, judge voting rates, school totals, and more.

All data is displayed on: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1INRJvMbJVD536GsjG4XaNlWLpRdYSAgyFPr9VLYn9vM/edit?usp=sharing
